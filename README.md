This reading group focuses on Machine Learning techniques that may be applied to the field of Natural Language Processing. Participants are encouraged to suggest topics, papers, or tutorials (which need not involve any current application in NLP) by adding them to the lists below. 

Suggesting a paper does not constitute any sort of commitment to presenting that paper.

Meetings are approximately every week on Mondays at 15:00 (GMT+1) unless otherwise stated. Announcements for this group will be made by email, and it is possible to sign up to the mailing list here.
