This is an *unofficial* web-home for the University of Edinburgh's ML-for-NLP reading group. 

This reading group focuses on Machine Learning techniques that may be applied to the field of Natural Language Processing. Participants are encouraged to suggest topics, papers, or tutorials (which need not involve any current application in NLP) by adding them to the lists below. 
Suggesting a paper does not constitute any sort of commitment to presenting that paper. 

We also have an ML-for-NLP channel in IF slack http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/admin/communications/useful-links

### Time and place
Meetings are approximately every week on Mondays at 15:00 (GMT+1) unless otherwise stated. Announcements for this group will be made by email, and it is possible to sign up to the mailing list [here](http://lists.inf.ed.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/ml-for-nlp).

The meetings usually take place in the Informatics forum room 3.02, but during the covid-19 lockdown the meetings have moved online: https://meet.google.com/jie-cnji-dok

### Paper proposal
To propose a paper for a weekly meeting open an issue or add a comment to an existing one. 
At the end of the week the paper with the most votes will be chosen (vote using thumbs-up in a comment).
